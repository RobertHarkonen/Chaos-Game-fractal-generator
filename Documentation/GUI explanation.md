1. Start/stop drawing.
2. Clear drawn fractal, but leave anchor points.
3. Clear everything.
4. Adjust drawing speed. An integer between 1 and 50000. Type the number and press ENTER.
5. Drawing granularity. The size of the dot drawn in each iteration step. Smaller values yield finer, more detailed fractals but take longer to draw.
6. Movement ratio. Which proportion of the distance toward the chosen anchor will be moved? Affects the shape of the fractal.
7. Repeat rule. If checked, the same anchor point cannot be chosen twice in a row. Affects the shape of the fractal.
8. Drawing color.
9. Drawing canvas. Click to add anchor points
10. Saved drawing settings.
11. Load chosen settings.
12. Delete chosen settings.
13. Name for saved settings.
14. Save settings with the chosen name.

## Some tips
- Place three anchor points in a triangle by clicking on the black canvas, then press start. You will see a famous fractal, the Sierpinski Triangle.
- Play around with different numbers of anchor points, movement ratios and the repeat rule to create many different shapes.
- By placing anchor points further from eachother, you can see more detail.
